Tier statistics for the native route (PF.2 phase 1): the same table
docs/native-compilation.md publishes for the prelude. Handler reporting keeps
syntactic resume shape separate from mode-aware native lowering: a tail-shaped
Once clause still materializes its affine token. Sig changes that move a row
tier land here on purpose, like the sigs goldens.

A file that does not resolve is an error, not a partial table:

  $ cat > bad.jqd <<'EOF_JQD'
  > (defterm ((binding boom () (app (var nowhere) (lit 1)))))
  > EOF_JQD
  $ jacquard tiers bad.jqd
  bad.jqd:1:33-46: error[E0301]: unknown name `nowhere`
  [1]

So is a file that resolves but does not typecheck, with source positions:

  $ cat > bad-type.jqd <<'EOF_JQD'
  > (defterm ((binding bad () (app (lit 1) (lit 2)))))
  > EOF_JQD
  $ jacquard tiers bad-type.jqd
  bad-type.jqd:1:27-48: error[E0802]: int is not a function
    hint: only functions, constructors, effect operations, and resumptions apply
  [1]
