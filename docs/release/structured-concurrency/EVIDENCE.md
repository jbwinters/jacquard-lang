# Structured Concurrency SC.4 Evidence

Status: every spawned child effect is charged through the exact once Async
interface represented by SC.3. The law now survives every supported
higher-order transport route. This milestone intentionally contains no
scheduling policy, executable structured scope, lifecycle engine, or
detached/root Async handler.

## Published declarations

`prelude/03-concurrency.jqd` publishes exactly `Task a`, `TaskResult a`, and the
four-operation `Async a` effect frozen by SC.0. The declaration identities are:

| declaration/member | HASH_V0 identity |
|---|---|
| `Task a` | `07791255b44e18c3830038c51396bd3f80cf44a8e89222ff73dc90dd06ec3fb3` |
| private `TaskOpaque` carrier | `9b4eaa5e872fa3f768c71fc4cba4d3262a9ebf8a719f0cfb78f22fa9eade4310` |
| `TaskResult a` | `915f69bd6fd8b34c2794b4b0e7ca88f5aafd0187e5c7c36a59091f6d031405ae` |
| `Done` | `8bb29144a0570c1b4e6da9f9bb899b7938bb5eda078f5800a7acb24bb295a095` |
| `Failed` | `ce8613a28d881583c0239bd1f4d65156e0f28d48f12d61f246f386a8b3fb0934` |
| `Cancelled` | `b2bbe23f39ea5e437f838e3bf9cfd030f6916f1d236b48716097a502328de697` |
| `Async a` | `4ff8ce05ab09968163492b3be40fc91381b47dee5fb4b2980f9416d50f38e66f` |
| `async.spawn` | `dae95472328cdc4e38d64b3dd71f49f8b99d1cabbc5a1be603d7d44cc3b0c4a5` |
| `async.await` | `7326d67de02f676afc476e7f16a3b4ee9617293865ffc8dd77ca7f0e9e8e675a` |
| `async.cancel` | `5371011ae9b806265e1f12224cbb5a44bb6aabe7e5396e68eca7babf4c3a93d0` |
| `async.yield` | `3f67a20859f53ca48578469efd2c4bc2956bfa6b37d241fcbf2fe19d1ddf3e6a` |

The prelude golden pins all whole/member hashes. Focused tests load every
declaration from the content-addressed store, print it, read it, rebuild the
kernel declaration, and re-hash the corresponding member. SC.4 changes no
declaration identity and adds no kernel or runtime form.

## Generalized child-effect law

The checker recognizes only the fully revalidated frozen `async.spawn`
identity. Its instantiated operation scheme uses one shared open row for the
child thunk and the operation call:

```text
(() ->{Async | e} a) ->{Async | e} Task a
```

Because the dependency is carried in the type, it survives an operation alias,
a higher-order forwarding function, a returned closure, tuple storage and
destructuring, independent Net/Fs row-polymorphic uses, and nested scopes. The
executable concurrency doctest pins every route and the documented aggregate:

```text
fetch-all : (List Text) ->{Net} TaskResult (List (TaskResult Text))
```

The manifest cram executes the same law through a wrapper. A console-only
manifest fails with E0814 naming `net.get`; a Net manifest succeeds, proving
that `async.scope` removed Async but did not remove Net. A misleading closed
annotation reports the propagated Net row. An adversarial row-polymorphic shape
fails with the same-tail occurs check at the `async.spawn` source, and the Types
regression rejects different effect sets sharing the same tail. Both negative
crams declare the complete frozen four-operation Async identity rather than a
near-match. A generated property checks that every subset of two independent
child effects remains visible in the shared caller row.

## Opaque Task boundary

The store retains the Task declaration and hash index but omits `TaskOpaque`
from the public constructor index. The checker, interpreter, and native lowerer
also reject the exact derived constructor hash with E0907, so a raw hash cannot
bypass name privacy. A single private-hash predicate also rejects `bind_name`
and persisted `names.jqd` entries, while declaration insertion evicts stale
private bindings. No Task equality, Show instance, or codec is published.
Internal diagnostic rendering is the redacted token `<task>` and never exposes
the owner token or deterministic ID.

The OCaml carrier owns an unforgeable evaluator-run token and the SC.0
`(scope-path, spawn-index)` identifier. Task construction is absent from the
public Eval interface; its implementation-only scheduler seam always uses the
active scope. The native runtime has a distinct `JQ_TASK` tag with the same
inert fields. Both domains admit at most 65,532 unsigned-32-bit path components
and an unsigned-32-bit spawn index. Both implementations validate shape, run,
and exact scope without selecting or running work.

Tests pin `0/2#3`, same-scope acceptance, E0907 for cross-scope/cross-run use,
and non-crashing malformed-handle diagnostics. Hostile callback tests cover a
foreign Task nested in tuple and constructor results through internal apply,
`run_expr`, capturing, and terminal states. Native allocation/reference-count/
show tests pin equivalent valid, malformed, foreign-run, foreign-scope,
uint32/uint16 boundary, exact stored-spawn overflow rejection, and redaction
behavior.

Reusable validated states and both validated and ordinary captured
continuations carry the exact originating evaluator context. Cross-context
execution, capture, and resume fail with E0907 before execution or Once-budget
consumption. A hostile regression validates a Task-bearing state under context
A, attempts execution and capture under B, exposes the captured Task argument,
and attempts both continuation APIs under B. Same-context runs continue through
the trusted scan-free sampling path.

The lower-level `run_state_capturing_once` carrier is context-bound as well:
its opaque `VOnceResume` state retains the originating evaluator-run token.
The direct `async.yield` regression captures under A, rejects invocation under
B with E0907 before consumption, then successfully resumes the same token under
A. Ordinary in-language Once resumptions share this private owner check.

## Async boundary and parity

All four Async operations are reviewed as `once`; no handler is installed.
Direct evaluator calls therefore reach the ordinary `Unhandled` result for
spawn, await, cancel, and yield. The CLI rejects an unhandled Async program at
its effect gate with E0814. Neither path schedules work or grants ambient
authority.

`TaskResult` constructors execute in both tiers. The `task-values.t` cram test
byte-compares interpreter and native output for Done/Failed/Cancelled, tests
the private carrier diagnostic, and pins the clean unhandled CLI failure. The
C/OCaml show parity corpus includes a redacted inert Task value.

## Reconstruction and verification

The manifest is the complete successor overlay on validated SC.3 commit
`ed02113`. Reconstruct it under repository-local scratch space:

```sh
base=ed02113
dest="$PWD/.scratch/sc4-evidence-copy"
manifest=docs/release/structured-concurrency/MANIFEST.sha256
rm -rf "$dest"
mkdir -p "$dest"
git archive "$base" | tar -x -C "$dest"
mkdir -p "$dest/$(dirname "$manifest")"
cp -p "$manifest" "$dest/$manifest"
awk '!/^#/ && NF == 2 {print $2}' "$manifest" |
while IFS= read -r file_path; do
  mkdir -p "$dest/$(dirname "$file_path")"
  cp -p "$file_path" "$dest/$file_path"
done
```

Run in both this checkout and the reconstructed copy:

```sh
eval "$(opam env)"
mkdir -p "$PWD/.scratch/tmp"
export TMPDIR="$PWD/.scratch/tmp"
scripts/release/check-structured-concurrency-manifest.sh
opam exec -- dune build @all
opam exec -- dune runtest --force
opam exec -- dune fmt
git diff --exit-code
opam exec -- dune build @doc
```

The scheduler, executable scopes, cancellation delivery, lifecycle state, and
root handler remain later C1 tasks. SC.4 is a checker/evidence milestone only;
its `async.scope` fixture is compile-only handler scaffolding and is never
claimed as scheduler execution.
