# Structured Concurrency SC.6 Evidence

Status: executable policy-independent structured-scope ownership, deterministic
nested lineage, recursive cleanup, and complete dynamic Task-escape detection
are implemented over the validated SC.4 child-effect law and SC.5 scheduler
core. This milestone intentionally contains no runnable-queue policy, routed
cancellation timing, host concurrency/I/O, or detached/root Async handler.

## Published declarations

`prelude/03-concurrency.jqd` publishes exactly `Task a`, `TaskResult a`, and the
four-operation `Async a` effect frozen by SC.0. The declaration identities are:

| declaration/member | HASH_V0 identity |
|---|---|
| `Task a` | `07791255b44e18c3830038c51396bd3f80cf44a8e89222ff73dc90dd06ec3fb3` |
| private `TaskOpaque` carrier | `9b4eaa5e872fa3f768c71fc4cba4d3262a9ebf8a719f0cfb78f22fa9eade4310` |
| `TaskResult a` | `915f69bd6fd8b34c2794b4b0e7ca88f5aafd0187e5c7c36a59091f6d031405ae` |
| `Done` | `8bb29144a0570c1b4e6da9f9bb899b7938bb5eda078f5800a7acb24bb295a095` |
| `Failed` | `ce8613a28d881583c0239bd1f4d65156e0f28d48f12d61f246f386a8b3fb0934` |
| `Cancelled` | `b2bbe23f39ea5e437f838e3bf9cfd030f6916f1d236b48716097a502328de697` |
| `Async a` | `4ff8ce05ab09968163492b3be40fc91381b47dee5fb4b2980f9416d50f38e66f` |
| `async.spawn` | `dae95472328cdc4e38d64b3dd71f49f8b99d1cabbc5a1be603d7d44cc3b0c4a5` |
| `async.await` | `7326d67de02f676afc476e7f16a3b4ee9617293865ffc8dd77ca7f0e9e8e675a` |
| `async.cancel` | `5371011ae9b806265e1f12224cbb5a44bb6aabe7e5396e68eca7babf4c3a93d0` |

The prelude golden pins all whole/member hashes. Focused tests load every
declaration from the content-addressed store, print it, read it, rebuild the
kernel declaration, and re-hash the corresponding member. SC.4 and SC.5 change
no declaration identity and add no kernel form.

## Generalized child-effect law

The checker recognizes only the fully revalidated frozen `async.spawn`
identity. Its instantiated operation scheme uses one shared open row for the
child thunk and the operation call:

```text
(() ->{Async | e} a) ->{Async | e} Task a
```

Because the dependency is carried in the type, it survives an operation alias,
a higher-order forwarding function, a returned closure, tuple storage and
destructuring, independent Net/Fs row-polymorphic uses, and nested scopes. The
executable concurrency doctest pins every route and the documented aggregate:

```text
fetch-all : (List Text) ->{Net} TaskResult (List (TaskResult Text))
```

The manifest cram executes the same law through a wrapper. A console-only
manifest fails with E0814 naming `net.get`; a Net manifest succeeds, proving
that `async.scope` removed Async but did not remove Net. A misleading closed
annotation reports the propagated Net row. An adversarial row-polymorphic shape
fails with the same-tail occurs check at the `async.spawn` source, and the Types
regression rejects different effect sets sharing the same tail. Both negative
crams declare the complete frozen four-operation Async identity rather than a
near-match. A generated property checks that every subset of two independent
child effects remains visible in the shared caller row. The converted-shape
defense fails closed with E0805 if a future checker refactor makes the validated
frozen declaration and its internal arrow disagree; a source regression keeps
that path diagnostic-only and forbids the former internal assertion.

## Opaque Task boundary

The store retains the Task declaration and hash index but omits `TaskOpaque`
from the public constructor index. The checker, interpreter, and native lowerer
also reject the exact derived constructor hash with E0907, so a raw hash cannot
bypass name privacy. A single private-hash predicate also rejects `bind_name`
and persisted `names.jqd` entries, while declaration insertion evicts stale
private bindings. No Task equality, Show instance, or codec is published.
Internal diagnostic rendering is the redacted token `<task>` and never exposes
the owner token or deterministic ID.

The OCaml carrier owns an unforgeable evaluator-run token and the SC.0
`(scope-path, spawn-index)` identifier. Task construction is absent from the
public Eval interface; its implementation-only scheduler seam always uses the
active scope. The native runtime has a distinct `JQ_TASK` tag with the same
inert fields. Both domains admit at most 65,532 unsigned-32-bit path components
and an unsigned-32-bit spawn index. Both implementations validate shape, run,
and exact scope without selecting or running work.

Tests pin `0/2#3`, same-scope acceptance, E0907 for cross-scope/cross-run use,
and non-crashing malformed-handle diagnostics. Hostile callback tests cover a
foreign Task nested in tuple and constructor results through internal apply,
`run_expr`, capturing, and terminal states. Native allocation/reference-count/
show tests pin equivalent valid, malformed, foreign-run, foreign-scope,
uint32/uint16 boundary, exact stored-spawn overflow rejection, and redaction
behavior.

Reusable validated states and both validated and ordinary captured
continuations carry the exact originating evaluator context. Cross-context
execution, capture, and resume fail with E0907 before execution or Once-budget
consumption. A hostile regression validates a Task-bearing state under context
A, attempts execution and capture under B, exposes the captured Task argument,
and attempts both continuation APIs under B. Same-context runs continue through
the trusted scan-free sampling path.

The lower-level `run_state_capturing_once` carrier is context-bound as well:
its opaque `VOnceResume` state retains the originating evaluator-run token.
The direct `async.yield` regression captures under A, rejects invocation under
B with E0907 before consumption, then successfully resumes the same token under
A. Ordinary in-language Once resumptions share this private owner check.

## Async boundary and parity

All four Async operations are reviewed as `once`; the taxonomy still marks
Async as reserved, and no handler or built-in `--allow` grant is installed.
Direct evaluator calls therefore reach the ordinary `Unhandled` result for
spawn, await, cancel, and yield. The CLI rejects an unhandled Async program at
its effect gate with E0814. Neither path schedules work or grants ambient
authority.

`TaskResult` constructors execute in both tiers. The `task-values.t` cram test
byte-compares interpreter and native output for Done/Failed/Cancelled, tests
the private carrier diagnostic, and pins the clean unhandled CLI failure. The
C/OCaml show parity corpus includes a redacted inert Task value.

## Scheduler lifecycle core

`Scheduler_core` owns deterministic body/child IDs, opaque scope-local handles,
task lifecycle, await edges, immutable terminal results, cooperative
cancellation requests, and opaque resume tokens. Resume ownership is
destructive: checkout removes the sole token, suspension returns one token, and
terminal transitions or cancellation delivery drop it. Explicit scope close
removes all wait edges and transfers remaining owned tokens to the caller for
destruction. Invalid lifecycle or ownership operations return E0908; foreign
handles continue to return E0907.

Await registration permits multiple same-scope waiters and preserves their
registration order on wakeup. Terminal awaits are immediate. Self-await and
closed cycles produce the frozen task-failure messages and terminalize cycle
members atomically with respect to wakeup reporting: every member drops its
resume and reaches `failed` before registration-ordered external waiters become
runnable. Multi-member evidence pins cycle-discovery grouping and per-member
registration order, including a cancelled external waiter that is omitted. No
terminal cycle member can appear in the returned wakeup list. The core returns
the handles made runnable by a transition but has no runnable queue and makes no
policy decision.

Focused Alcotest and QCheck coverage pins the transition table, resume-token
ownership, deterministic IDs, yield suspension/wakeup, multiple waiters,
immediate terminal awaits, completion/failure/cancellation, self-await, closed
two- and three-node cycles, external/cancelled waiter controls, the complete
public rejection table, identical back-to-back scenarios, a property that every
observed lifecycle transition satisfies the frozen contract, a property that
every returned wakeup is runnable with one resume, close cleanup, and
foreign-handle diagnostics. The existing handler
gauntlet and interpreter/native runtime suites continue to cover affine Once
capture enforcement and the inert Task boundary around this core.

## Structured scope ownership and escape boundary

`Structured_scope` opens root path `[0]` and uses the scheduler core's new
same-run construction seam for nested paths. Every nested scope appends a
one-based creation ordinal and is registered with its parent. The layer exposes
the lifecycle operations only while that exact scope remains open; stale or
cross-scope use is E0907. It introduces no queue, scheduling policy, host
thread, effect route, or root handler.

Normal return, result-level abort, and host exceptions share one explicit
bracket cleanup. Descendants close recursively, unfinished tasks become
cancelled, wait edges are cleared, and every scheduler-owned resume token is
passed exactly once to the destruction callback. Cleanup completes before an
escape diagnostic is returned. Recursive counters for open scopes, live tasks,
runnable tasks, and owned resumes all return to zero, so no registered child
continuation remains runnable after its scope returns. Repeated close is
idempotent. This is continuation-memory cleanup, not an automatic external
resource finalizer; acquire/release handlers remain required around suspended
resources.

The exit guard rejects returned or stored handles whose creation path is the
closing scope or any descendant. A nested close may still observe a valid
enclosing-scope handle. `Eval.reject_task_escape` walks the full reachable
runtime-value graph, including tuples, constructors, closure cells, cyclic
closure environments, and multi-shot resumptions, validating the opaque run
before the path-prefix check.

Focused lifecycle tests cover joins, forgotten children, three-level nested
lineage, recursive normal/abort cleanup, returned and stored escapes, foreign
and enclosing handles, stale post-close operations, result aborts, and host
exceptions. A 200-case QCheck property constructs nested chains and proves that
every ownership counter returns to baseline. Dynamic graph tests hide Tasks in
all supported carrier shapes. The native ASAN/LSAN runtime lane additionally
tears down 4,096 Task and resume-shaped carriers at a simulated scope boundary,
pinning explicit carrier release without claiming a native scheduler.

## Reconstruction and verification

The manifest is the complete SC.6 successor overlay on validated SC.4 + SC.5
integration commit `9708ee1`. Reconstruct it under repository-local scratch
space:

```sh
base=9708ee1
dest="$PWD/.scratch/sc6-evidence-copy"
manifest=docs/release/structured-concurrency/MANIFEST.sha256
rm -rf "$dest"
mkdir -p "$dest"
git archive "$base" | tar -x -C "$dest"
mkdir -p "$dest/$(dirname "$manifest")"
cp -p "$manifest" "$dest/$manifest"
awk '!/^#/ && NF == 2 {print $2}' "$manifest" |
while IFS= read -r file_path; do
  mkdir -p "$dest/$(dirname "$file_path")"
  cp -p "$file_path" "$dest/$file_path"
done
```

Run in both this checkout and the reconstructed copy:

```sh
eval "$(opam env)"
mkdir -p "$PWD/.scratch/tmp"
export TMPDIR="$PWD/.scratch/tmp"
scripts/release/check-structured-concurrency-manifest.sh
opam exec -- dune build @all
opam exec -- dune runtest --force
opam exec -- dune fmt
git diff --exit-code
opam exec -- dune build @doc
```

Expected results are zero exits, 603 compiled Alcotest/QCheck cases, 34 cram
transcripts, and 24 doctest examples across 7 documents.

Runnable-queue policy, cooperative cancellation routing, failure policy, and
the Async root handler remain later C1 tasks. SC.6 supplies executable
scope ownership and cleanup over opaque resume tokens, but it does not run a
continuation or install the compile-only `async.scope` fixture as a root
handler. SC.4 continues to supply the static child-effect law, including the
law that a scope discharges only Async and retains child world effects.
